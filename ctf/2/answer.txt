The lockit.py file has used seed as time of creation of file. Whenever the same seeds are used for generating random integers, the same sequences are produced.
We found the time of creation of secret.docx.enc, which gave us the seed used for encryption, but it did not decrypt and create a valid docx file. After randomly adding and subtracting some integers from the exact time, a seed with value (time+3) gave a valid docx file.
