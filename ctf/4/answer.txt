We are trying to exploit safe_strcpy, as it is not really safe, and the variable `buf` can be overflown by a byte(off-by-one error as suggested in the hint). Thus, we can perform a GOT attack here, by using the statement *p =a, by overwriting the address p with the address of _exit was jumping to(from GOT), and by overwriting a with the address of read_flag. This runs the function read_flag, which reveals the contents of the flag file.
